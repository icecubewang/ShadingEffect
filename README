This repo contains my attempt of using OpenGL and javascript to create a scene with the following objects:
- a sphere (left most, grey) with bling_phong shading 
- a sphere (middle, grey) with phong illumination
- a sphere (middle, colorful) with refraction
- a sphere (right most, colorful) with texture mapping to resemble the effect of reflection

The three .png screenshots are the effect. Check them out!

Explanation for mapping:
	_________ (u, v)
	|                |
	|                |
	|	 ________|
    (0, 0)
R.y > abs(R.x) and R.y > abs(R.z) gives the top square of the sphere. 
We are trying to map the texture to that square. 
(0, 0) is mapped to when R.x/R.y = -1 and R.z/R.y = 1
while 
(1, 1) is mapped to when R.x/R.y = 1 and R.z/R.y = -1
