This repo contains my attempt of using OpenGL and javascript to create a scene with the following objects:
- a sphere (left most, grey) with bling_phong shading 
- a sphere (middle, grey) with phong illumination
- a sphere (middle, colorful) with refraction
- a sphere (right most, colorful) with texture mapping to resemble the effect of reflection

The three .png screenshots are the effect. Check them out!

To run the code on your own repo:
1. Clone the entire repo.
2. Use terminal, enter the repo and run:
	$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
	OR
	$python -m http.server
	Depending on your python version.
	The following message should appear:
	Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
3. Open a web browser (Chrome prefered) and go to:
	localhost:8000
4. Click on a3.html
5. Feel free to navigate around and add your own stuff!

Explanation for mapping:
	_________ (u, v)
	|                |
	|                |
	|	 ________|
    (0, 0)
R.y > abs(R.x) and R.y > abs(R.z) gives the top square of the sphere. 
We are trying to map the texture to that square. 
(0, 0) is mapped to when R.x/R.y = -1 and R.z/R.y = 1
while 
(1, 1) is mapped to when R.x/R.y = 1 and R.z/R.y = -1
